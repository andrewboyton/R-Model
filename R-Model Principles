Human-to-Human Connection Principle
The R-Model begins with the recognition that every meaningful relationship is fundamentally a human-to-human interaction operating according to universal principles, regardless of context. This means that the same core capacities that enable someone to create a sustainable connection with a spouse also enhance their ability to build effective working relationships with colleagues, maintain healthy friendships, or navigate family dynamics successfully. Rather than treating different relationship types as requiring entirely separate skill sets, the R-Model identifies transferable human relationship capacities that apply across all domains of connection.
This universality principle emerges from observing that people who excel at relationship building tend to apply similar approaches whether they are resolving conflict with a romantic partner, providing feedback to a team member, or establishing trust with a new friend. The surface behaviours may look different, but the underlying relationship dynamics follow consistent patterns that can be understood, measured, and improved.
