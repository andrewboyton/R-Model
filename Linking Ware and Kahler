# R-Model Theory White Paper: Relational Alignment and Reciprocity Between Present Experience of Self (PEoS)

**A Reference Document for Theoretical Foundation and Practical Application**

-----

## Executive Summary

This white paper examines the theoretical foundations underlying R-Model Theory’s approach to relational alignment and reciprocity between Present Experience of Self (PEoS), with particular focus on the integration of Paul Ware’s Three Doors Sequence and Taibi Kahler’s Process Communication Model (PCM). Drawing on established transactional analysis principles, contemporary neuroscience, and socioaffective alignment theory, this document establishes the scientific basis for understanding how individuals coordinate their authentic self-experience within interpersonal systems whilst maintaining psychological autonomy and promoting mutual growth.

The analysis reveals that effective relational alignment requires sophisticated integration of contact preferences (Thinking, Feeling, Behaviour), personality structure dynamics, and reciprocal element exchanges, all mediated by the fundamental principle of symphysis—growing together whilst remaining distinct. This framework provides practitioners with evidence-based approaches for facilitating sustainable human connection across diverse contexts.

## 1. Theoretical Foundations

### 1.1 The Present Experience of Self (PEoS): A Defining Construct

The Present Experience of Self (PEoS) represents the dynamic, contextual awareness of one’s immediate psychological state, encompassing the interplay between essence, vitality, values, vulnerability, vision, identity, memory, and present-moment consciousness. Unlike static personality constructs, PEoS recognises that self-experience fluctuates based on internal processes, environmental demands, and relational contexts.

This construct aligns with contemporary neuroscience research by Friston and Solms, who propose that consciousness emerges through active inference processes whereby organisms continuously update predictive models about their internal states relative to environmental uncertainty. The PEoS framework suggests that relational alignment occurs when two individuals can coordinate their predictive models of each other whilst maintaining access to their own authentic self-experience.

### 1.2 Paul Ware’s Three Doors Sequence: Contact and Connection Architecture

Paul Ware’s seminal 1983 research identified three fundamental contact modalities through which individuals engage relationally: Thinking, Feeling, and Behaviour. Ware’s model proposes that each person has distinct preferences for initial contact (Open Door), therapeutic direction (Target Door), and areas of resistance (Trap Door).

**The Three Doors Framework:**

- **Open Door**: The preferred modality for establishing initial rapport and trust. Individuals feel most comfortable and authentic when approached through this channel.
- **Target Door**: The developmental pathway that, once rapport is established, offers the greatest potential for growth and change.
- **Trap Door**: The contact modality that generates resistance, defensiveness, or withdrawal when prematurely engaged.

This sequence varies according to personality adaptation, with each individual requiring a tailored approach to contact that respects their particular door configuration. For instance, individuals with a Brilliant Sceptic adaptation typically have Thinking as their Open Door, Feeling as their Target Door, and Behaviour as their Trap Door.

The implications for relational alignment are profound: successful PEoS coordination requires understanding and respecting each person’s door sequence, allowing for authentic engagement that honours individual contact preferences whilst creating conditions for mutual growth.

### 1.3 Taibi Kahler’s Process Communication Model: Personality Structure Dynamics

Taibi Kahler’s Process Communication Model, developed in the 1970s and refined through NASA’s astronaut selection processes, identifies six personality types that exist within each individual: Thinker, Harmoniser, Persister, Rebel, Imaginer, and Promoter. Crucially, PCM recognises that all six types exist within each person, organised in a hierarchical structure that remains stable after approximately age six, though accessibility to different “floors” can vary based on life experiences and current context.

**PCM’s Contribution to Relational Alignment:**

1. **Personality Structure Awareness**: Understanding that each person embodies all six types in different proportions allows for more nuanced relational approaches.
1. **Communication Channel Recognition**: Each personality type has preferred communication channels, psychological needs, and stress patterns that become observable through verbal and non-verbal cues.
1. **Distress Pattern Identification**: Kahler’s research revealed predictable behavioural sequences that occur before individuals enter psychological distress, providing early intervention opportunities.
1. **Positive Motivation Strategies**: Each personality type thrives under specific conditions that support their core psychological needs.

### 1.4 Integration with R-Model Reciprocal Elements

The R-Model’s 39 positive reciprocal elements (Care, Communication, Curiosity, etc.) and 9 negative elements (Comparison, Criticism, Contempt, etc.) provide the operational framework for translating Ware’s contact preferences and Kahler’s personality dynamics into specific relational behaviours that promote or inhibit alignment.

**Strategic Integration Patterns:**

- **Foundation Combinations**: Care + Communication + Consistency create the bedrock conditions necessary for individuals to access their Open Doors safely.
- **Growth-Oriented Combinations**: Curiosity + Coach + Celebration align with Ware’s Target Door concept by providing developmental support.
- **Personality-Responsive Combinations**: Different element combinations resonate more strongly with different PCM types, allowing for personalised relational approaches.

## 2. Relational Alignment Theory: Core Mechanisms

### 2.1 Socioaffective Alignment and Mutual Adaptation

Recent research on human-AI relationships has introduced the concept of socioaffective alignment—how systems behave within social and psychological ecosystems where preferences and perceptions evolve through mutual influence. This principle applies directly to human-human relationships, where successful alignment requires ongoing adaptation to each other’s evolving PEoS whilst maintaining individual authenticity.

Social cognition research reveals that alignment in relationships emerges from reciprocal information exchange rather than simply pursuing shared goals. The quality and nature of information exchange between interacting agents determines whether an interaction becomes genuinely social.

### 2.2 The Symphysis Principle: Connected Autonomy

The R-Model’s symphysis principle addresses a fundamental challenge in relational alignment: how individuals can grow together whilst maintaining distinct identities. Drawing from anatomical metaphors where bones grow together whilst preserving individual integrity, symphysis suggests that healthy relationships enhance rather than diminish individual authenticity.

**Symphysis operates through three mechanisms:**

1. **Boundary Preservation**: Clear delineation between self and other that prevents enmeshment whilst allowing intimate connection.
1. **Mutual Enhancement**: Each person’s growth supports and is supported by the other’s development.
1. **Adaptive Responsiveness**: The relationship system evolves to accommodate individual changes without losing its core structure.

### 2.3 The Three P’s: Permission, Protection, and Potency

The R-Model’s Three P’s framework provides the architectural support for sustainable relational alignment:

**Permission** grants each person freedom to express their authentic PEoS and explore developmental possibilities, even when this challenges existing relationship patterns.

**Protection** ensures safety during the vulnerable processes of self-expression and growth, maintaining relational stability whilst individuals take risks.

**Potency** acknowledges each person’s capacity to effect meaningful change both individually and relationally, preventing learned helplessness or dependency patterns.
