## Karl Friston and Mark Solms: The Nature of Self and Discomfort

Karl Friston and Mark Solms have developed a revolutionary understanding of consciousness, the self, and discomfort that fundamentally reframes how we conceptualise human experience. Their collaborative work bridges computational neuroscience with psychoanalytic theory, offering profound insights that connect remarkably well with the R-Model’s principles.

### The Free Energy Principle and Self-Organisation

Friston’s Free Energy Principle describes how biological systems maintain their existence by minimising prediction error and maintaining their internal organisation against the forces of entropy. The brain operates as a predictive machine that continuously generates models of the world and works to minimise the difference between those predictions and incoming sensory data.   This creates what Friston calls “active inference”—organisms don’t merely respond to their environment but actively seek to confirm their predictions about the world.

For consciousness to emerge, Friston argues that a system must be capable of making “temporally thick” inferences—projections not just about the present but about past and future states. This prospective dimension of active inference, where organisms can project themselves through time and select actions to minimise expected future uncertainty, appears crucial for conscious experience.  

### Solms’ Affective Foundation of Consciousness

Mark Solms revolutionises our understanding by proposing that consciousness fundamentally originates in the brainstem rather than the cortex, with affect—felt emotional experience—serving as the primary substrate of conscious awareness. His neuropsychoanalytic approach reveals that the upper brainstem is intrinsically conscious whilst the cortex derives its consciousness from brainstem mechanisms.  

Solms identifies consciousness with “felt uncertainty”—the subjective experience of navigating unpredictable environments. When organisms encounter situations where their predictive models fail, they experience affective arousal that prioritises survival needs and guides decision-making. This affect isn’t merely an add-on to cognitive processing but represents the very essence of conscious experience.  

### The Nature of Self Through Homeostatic Mechanisms

Both theorists ground the self in homeostatic mechanisms—the fundamental biological imperative to maintain organisational integrity. For self-organising systems to exist, they must resist entropy by occupying “preferred states” rather than dispersing across all possible states. This creates what they call a “Markov blanket”—a boundary separating internal and external states that enables the system to maintain its identity. 

The self emerges through this homeostatic process as organisms develop increasingly sophisticated models of their internal states relative to environmental demands. Solms and Friston propose that subjective experience arises precisely when these internal regulatory processes encounter uncertainty—when the system must actively resolve conflicts between competing predictions or needs.  

### Discomfort as Information Processing

Their understanding of discomfort connects directly to information theory. As Solms explains, “the less predictable the environment and the greater the entropy, the more information is available.” Discomfort represents the system’s registration of increased uncertainty, unpredictability, and surprise—essentially measuring the information-processing demands placed on the organism. 

Discomfort thus serves as a crucial signal indicating when the organism’s predictive models are failing and when active intervention is required to maintain homeostasis. Rather than being merely unpleasant, discomfort represents the felt experience of entropy threatening the system’s organisational integrity. 

### Connections to the R-Model

The R-Model has been influenced by Friston and Solm.

This work offers profound insights for understanding the R-Model’s reciprocal elements. The Friston-Solms framework suggests several key connections:

**Uncertainty as Relationship Driver**: Just as individual consciousness emerges from managing uncertainty, relationships may develop their sustainable patterns through collaborative management of interpersonal uncertainty. The R-Model’s reciprocal elements like curiosity, communication, and commitment can be understood as mechanisms for reducing relational entropy whilst maintaining individual boundaries.

**Affect as Relational Information**: Following Solms’ affect-primary approach, the emotional dimensions of relationship—care, comfort, courage—represent information about the relational system’s homeostatic state. When relationships feel “off,” this discomfort signals that the dyadic system’s predictive models about each other are failing. 

**Markov Blankets in Relationships**: Friston’s concept of Markov blankets—boundaries between self and environment—applies directly to the R-Model’s symphysis principle. Healthy relationships require clear boundaries that allow two distinct individuals to interact meaningfully without losing their separate identities.

**Predictive Processing in Relationships**: Just as individual brains create predictive models of the world, people in relationships develop predictive models of each other. The R-Model’s elements like consistency, confirmation, and clarity function as mechanisms for maintaining accurate interpersonal predictions and reducing relational uncertainty.

**Active Inference in Connection**: The free energy principle’s emphasis on active inference—changing the world to match predictions rather than only updating predictions—illuminates how people actively shape their relationships to confirm their models of connection and care.

This theoretical foundation suggests that the R-Model’s reciprocal elements represent sophisticated mechanisms for managing the information-theoretic challenges of maintaining sustainable human connection whilst preserving individual autonomy and promoting mutual growth. The discomfort experienced in challenging relationships may signal entropy threatening the relational system’s organisational integrity, whilst the positive reciprocal elements function as homeostatic mechanisms for maintaining healthy relational boundaries and shared predictive models.
