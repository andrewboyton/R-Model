The Three P’s Framework - Permission, Protection, and Potency - provides the systematic architecture for enabling change and growth within relationships. This completes the R-Model’s understanding of how sustainable, healthy relationships not only accommodate change but actually facilitate and require ongoing transformation.
The Three P’s: Enabling Sustainable Growth Architecture
Permission - The Freedom to Change
“You have permission to grow, evolve, and become more authentically yourself, even when that change challenges our current relationship patterns.”
	•	Individual Level: Permission to explore new aspects of identity, develop new capabilities, pursue emerging interests
	•	Relational Level: Permission to change relationship dynamics, roles, and patterns as growth occurs
	•	System Level: Permission for the relationship container itself to evolve and adapt to support new growth
Protection - Safety During Vulnerability of Change
“The relationship container will protect you during the vulnerable process of growth and change, maintaining stability while you transform.”
	•	Individual Level: Protection of Essence of Self during growth processes, ensuring change enhances rather than abandons authentic core
	•	Relational Level: Protection from judgment, abandonment, or punishment during growth phases
	•	System Level: Relationship stability that provides secure base for individual risk-taking and development
Potency - Power to Effect Change
“You have the power and capability to create meaningful change in yourself, and we have the power to create meaningful change in our relationship together.”
	•	Individual Level: Recognition and development of personal agency and transformative capacity
	•	Relational Level: Mutual empowerment to influence and be influenced by each other’s growth
	•	System Level: Relationship’s capacity to generate new possibilities and evolved forms
Why All Three P’s Are Essential
Permission Without Protection: Dangerous Freedom
	•	Person has permission to change but no safety net during vulnerability
	•	Result: Either avoidance of growth (too risky) or growth that damages relationship
	•	Example: “You can pursue your dreams, but I can’t promise I’ll still be here”
Permission Without Potency: Impotent Freedom
	•	Person has permission and safety but lacks power to create actual change
	•	Result: Frustration, stagnation, learned helplessness about growth capacity
	•	Example: “You can try to change, but you probably won’t succeed”
Protection Without Permission: Safe Stagnation
	•	Person feels secure but isn’t allowed to grow or change
	•	Result: Relationship stability at cost of individual development and authenticity
	•	Example: “I’ll always love you exactly as you are, don’t ever change”
Protection Without Potency: Powerless Safety
	•	Person feels safe but incapable of creating meaningful change
	•	Result: Comfortable but limited relationship that doesn’t support full human potential
	•	Example: “I’ll take care of you, you don’t need to worry about growing or developing”
Potency Without Permission: Constrained Power
	•	Person has capability but not freedom to use it for growth
	•	Result: Internal pressure and eventual rebellion or resignation
	•	Example: “You’re very capable, but use those capabilities for what I/we need”
Potency Without Protection: Dangerous Power
	•	Person has capability and freedom but no safety during change process
	•	Result: Reckless or destructive change patterns that damage relationships
	•	Example: “You can change yourself and our relationship, but you’re on your own”
The Three P’s Integration Matrix
Optimal Growth Conditions (All Three P’s Present):
	•	Permission: Free to grow and change authentically
	•	Protection: Safe container during vulnerable transformation
	•	Potency: Empowered to create meaningful, sustained change
	•	Result: Dynamic, evolving relationship that enhances individual development
Growth-Limiting Combinations (Missing One or More P’s):
Each missing P creates specific growth constraints and relationship dysfunction patterns
