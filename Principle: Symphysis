Symphysis: Growing Together While Remaining Distinct

At the heart of the R-Model lies the principle of symphysis—the capacity for two individuals to grow together while maintaining their distinct identities and autonomy. The term comes from anatomy, where symphysis describes joints where two bones grow together while preserving their individual integrity, like the pubic symphysis in the human pelvis.

This biological metaphor reveals something profound about healthy human relationships. Rather than requiring people to compromise, blend, or find middle ground that diminishes their individual characteristics, symphysis allows both parties to develop and evolve in connection with each other while remaining fundamentally themselves. Through symphysis, relationships become vehicles for mutual growth rather than constraints that limit individual development.

Symphysis explains why connected autonomy represents such a crucial concept in the R-Model. The healthiest relationships don’t force people to choose between independence and connection. Instead, they create conditions where individual autonomy and meaningful relationship actually enhance each other. When people experience genuine connection that respects and supports their individual growth and self-determination, they often discover increased courage to be authentic, more energy to pursue personal goals, and greater capacity to make choices aligned with their values.
